## Project Scope:

The project aims to create a society that contributes towards food sustainability by reducing food waste and promoting responsible consumption.

ReFoodify allows users to save near expiry food items at their home by suggesting to convert these items into delicious meals rather than throwing them away. It also allows users to share their recipes as well, which other users can use to prepare their meals.

In addition to that, it allows users to buy near expiry discounted food items available in their nearby supermarkets. When a user buys these items from the website, the user gets `reward points` on every purchase made, which can be seen in the user account page. As the user reaches `5000 reward points`, the user can get a `5€` discount on the next purchase. This is to incentives user interaction and help them to save money on their purchases.

# Project Description:

ReFoodify is a comprehensive platform that combines recipes, shopping, and user management. It allows users to create, manage, and search for recipes, shop for products, and manage their profiles. The system ensures secure user access and data protection, offering CRUD operations for recipes, products, and user profiles. It's designed with redux for scalability and maintainability in mind, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.

# Usage

### Part 1

- **Install Frontend Dependencies & Start the App**  
   Navigate to the frontend directory `ReFoodify-main`, install dependencies, and start the application:

  ```sh
  cd ReFoodify-main
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

### Part 2

- **Install Backend Dependencies & Start the Server**
  Navigate to the `Group6-be-api` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
cd Group6-be-api
npm install
node seed.js
npm run dev
```

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```sh
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=`mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.zvk7d.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
SECRET=your_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
TEST_MONGO_URI=`mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.zvk7d.mongodb.net/<test_database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
```

Replace <db_username>, <db_password>, <database_name>, and <test_database_name> with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials and database names.

### Part 3

  ```sh
   cd Group6-be-api
   npm install
   npm test
  ```

### Part 4

- Once the server is running, you can access the Swagger JSON endpoints at the following URL:

`http://localhost:4001/api`

- The Swagger JSON file can be accessed directly at:
  `http://localhost:4001/api/swagger.json`
